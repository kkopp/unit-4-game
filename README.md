# Crystal-Collector

## Instructions
A random number to be guessed will be generated at the beginning of each game.

There are four randomly chosen crystals. When the crystal is clicked, a specific amount of points will be added to the total guessed.

The game is won when the total guessed matches the random number that was generated at the beginning of the game. The game is lost when the total guessed goes over the random number.

IMPORTANT! The value of each crystal is unknown until it is clicked and the value of each crystal will change when the game is either won or lost.
